# Tradespace Exploration Python

This project contains Python scripts and data files for tradespace exploration and analysis. 
The scripts generate plots, calculate utilities, and process design data for architectural decisions.

# Requirements

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

### Setting up the Virtual Environment

1. Clone the repository:
2. Create a virtual environment: python -m venv venv
3. Activate the virtual environment:
- On Windows:
  ```
  .\venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
- On macOS and Linux:
  ```
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

4. Install the required packages: pip install -r requirements.txt


# Usage: Initial tradespace exploration

## Architectural decisions, options and metrics 

Open the `decision.json` file and adjust it accordingly. 


## Generate design points for each decisison/option combination

Run `generate_design.py` to generate all theoretically possible design points and calculate the cost and performance values. 

## Add reference designs: products with well knows cost and performence metric which help with validation of the models

Open `reference_designs.json` file and adjust it accordingly. 
Copying parts of `designs.json` may help initialy

## Create tradespace 

1. Edit the config part to configurate which design points to include and which metrics/utility to generate 
2. Run `tradespace.py`


## Final selection

1. Edit "" to decide uppn the final set of design points
2. Config and run the `tradespace.py`

# Usage: Add uncertinaty 

## 

## 




# Usage: Add uncetainty

# Possible ToDos:
 1. Allow for flexible adjusting of the performence metrics
 2. Optionally run the `calculate_utility_for_reference_designs.py` to use the utility model for the reference desigs 
 encapsulate the cost and performance model
 3. Make `tradespace.py` parametrisable and ret rid of the config section
 4. 




Calculates utility values for reference designs based on various factors.

### `combine_plots.py`

Combines multiple plots horizontally using the `PIL` library.

### `combine_plots_vertical.py`

Combines multiple plots vertically using the `PIL` library.

### `generate_design.py`

Generates design data for tradespace exploration.

### `tradespace.py`

Main script for tradespace exploration. It generates scatter plots, calculates Pareto designs, and saves the results to JSON files.

## Data Files

### `decisions.json`

Contains architectural decisions data.

### `designs.json`

Contains design data for tradespace exploration.

### `pareto_designs.json`

Contains Pareto designs data.

### `reference_designs.json`

Contains reference designs data.

## Usage

1. Run `generate_design.py` to generate design data.
2. Run `tradespace.py` to perform tradespace exploration and generate plots.
3. Use `combine_plots.py` and `combine_plots_vertical.py` to combine generated plots as needed.
