# Tradespace Exploration Python

This project contains Python scripts and data files for tradespace exploration and analysis. 
The scripts generate plots, calculate utilities, and process design data for architectural decisions.

# Requirements

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

### Setting up the Virtual Environment

1. Clone the repository:
2. Create a virtual environment: python -m venv venv
3. Activate the virtual environment:
- On Windows:
  ```
  .\venv\Scripts\activate
  ```
- On macOS and Linux:
  ```
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```

4. Install the required packages: pip install -r requirements.txt


# Usage: Initial tradespace exploration

## Architectural decisions, options and metrics 

Open the `input_data/decision.json` file and adjust it accordingly. 
Open the `input_data/selected_designs.json` file and adjust it accordingly. 

## Calculate design points metrics

Run `calculate_metrics.py` 


## Create tradespace 

1. Run `new_tradespace.py`
2. Find the tradespace in `Output_data/Tradespace.png` 


# Step by step System Engineering:

1. What are the Architectureal Decisison
2. what ar the options
3. what is the reference design and what are the options for it
4. what are the most important metrics
5. estimate the metrics value for the referenece design
6. what is the cost and performence model
7. estimate factors for each option for each metric and costs 
8. compere it for the reference design and reflec
9. generate tradespaces depending on the options
10. reflect - do you need all thouse options, do you need diferen metrics, different preformence model
11. add uncertianties 
...


# Usage: Add uncetainty

# Possible ToDos:
 1. Allow for flexible adjusting of the performence metrics
 2. Optionally run the `calculate_utility_for_reference_designs.py` to use the utility model for the reference desigs 
 encapsulate the cost and performance model
 3. Make `tradespace.py` parametrisable and ret rid of the config section
 100. Add linter and formater
 101. Add some tests
